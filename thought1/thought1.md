What does it mean for something to be true?

What can we do to verify that something is true?

How can we discover new truths?

This article is about a conceptual model of truth that may help answer
these questions.
I'm personally motivated to consider these questions because I'd like to
re-evaluate the scientific method --- the search for truth.

I'll argue that this line of pursuit aligns with an understanding of human
thought itself. As a result, these questions also pertain to another deep
interest of mine, which is writing software that we would recognize as a person.

# A traditional view

The usual view of truth is that an idea is true exactly when
it corresponds to the actual state of the world. A concept you
need to bundle along with any definition of truth is a concept
of what kinds of things are candidates for truth; previous
philosophers have argued that suitable *sentences* or
*propositions* are good candidates for truth. The word *suitable*
here refers to the need to avoid tricky cases such as
*"This sentence is false."* I won't dwell on the tricky
cases because I think they are mostly a distraction from
the meat of the issue.

The reason I'm not a fan of this definition is that it
doesn't really explain much. It doesn't tell us how we can
verify truthiness. We're left asking what it means to
correspond to the state of the world. It seems to simply
exchange one word for a few more without helping us
learn anything new in the process.

Rather than arguing that this semi-tautological perspective
is *wrong*, I'll simply provide another that I think is
more useful. Consider it the difference between Roman
numerals and our usual Arabic base-10 decimal notation.
It's harder
to do long division with Roman numerals, whereas
the structure of a number captured by base-10 notation
is *useful* --- it enables us to take certain
actions that might be more difficult with other notations,
even though it adds no new information.
This is the kind of *usefulness* I'm arguing exists
in an alternative model of truth.

# A practical view

I won't be so bold as to redefine truth itself, but I will introduce a
phrase to capture an idea that I think we all implicitly use without
quite naming it. This is the idea of *effective truth*;
when I say something is *effectively true*, I mean that
it tends to help us achieve a goal we have in mind.

An easy example to consider would be to say that a certain book
at a certain store costs $10. We could achieve our goal of buying that
book by walking into that store with a $10 bill and paying for that
book, ignoring tax and pretending that people still use paper money.

A more interesting example is to understand the uses and limits of our
own internal model of physics. Suppose you take a cylinder of wood and roll
it on a flat surface. You can reasonably expect it to move smoothly,
gradually slowing down. Imagine doing the same thing with an empty glass jar ---
same result. In fact, most solid cylindrical objects will act the same, so
we have a useful model for predicting how objects will move on their own based
on this.

Now imagine someone gives you a jar half-filled with water, and you also roll
it on a flat surface. If you've never done anything like this before, then you
might be surprised by how uneven the motion is. Even if you've done this before,
you'll find that you have much less certainty about how it will move than
in the other cases. The point is that often our ideas about how the world work
are useful simplifications. In this case I'd say the simplification is
the idea that "most cylinders act as if they were solid and had uniform
density."

You might respond that this seems like an arbitrary example that is a
simplification, whereas other ideas are more clearly true or false.
I'd respond by saying that, as far as we know, all of our ideas of parts of
the world are models rather than exact representations.
To return for a moment to the $10 book, suppose the store burns down before you
get there. Would you say it still costs $10 at that store? How do you know
they won't raise their prices? What if there was a computer error in their
pricing system, and half of people were charged $10 and the other half were
charged $12? These may feel like edge cases, but the point itself is that
unclear edge cases *always* exist.

If you concede that human ideas are imperfect models that help us achieve our
goals, then you can see how it's useful to speak about effective truths rather
than to insist on an idealized version of truth that could only make perfect
sense if it knew all the rules of physics to the smallest detail.

### Relevance and social truths

I want to briefly mention two other potential essential properties of truth.

One is that the *relevance* of an idea seems to be important for that idea to
be discussed as true or false. Suppose a certain particle of dust in a far-off
galaxy may or may not one day collide with another certain particle of dust. The
point of this example is that no one cares. Neither outcome will have any
bearing on any human.

The traditional model of truth applies equally well to these particles of dust
as it does to the more pertinent question of whether or not an asteroid
will collide with Earth and destroy our species. I won't argue that this is
a downfall of the traditional model, but rather that how humans think is closer
to effective truth because we don't bother with things that don't matter. From
a certain point of view we basically *can't* think about completely irrelevant
ideas because we simply don't see them.

The other potential essential property I wanted to mention is *social truth,*
by which I mean the sense that some ideas are accepted or not based on
large-scale social behaviors. For example, what kind of clothes are currently in
fashion? While some specific people have more influence on this than others,
this kind of truth is ultimately up to the actions of the many.
Another example of social truth is (XXX eg Star Wars or similar)



(truth is what is effective; cf relevant / completely true / social/authority)
(degrees of truthiness)
(the idea of truth itself as a useful fiction)

(Charles Pierce / Karl Popper)

### Isn't it true even if no one knows it?

What would that even mean? (want a good analogy)

# A model of thought

(goals / questions / answers / actions)
(actions as proofs / algorithms)

# A bigger picture

(philosophy as humanity's relationship with the world,
 not about the world itself)

(David Hume, Descartes)

(aim to close with the big picture idea and some argument as to why)
