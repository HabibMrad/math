Math Notes
==========

This is a collection
(ok, just one to start with)
of math notes I would like
to be open source.
I would be very happy if
anyone took the time to make
any improvements to the paper(s).

What to contribute
------------------

Leave the essential content
of the papers to be unchanged.
More is not better.
I would love to see changes that
clarify the content, and make
the papers easier to read.

How to contribute
-----------------

Treat this as you would any other
open source project on github.
If you're new to pull requests,
here's a
[how-to page](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).
