% Notes on Ramey's Lemmas

In a 1960 paper, George Raney proved
the first two lemmas below; the lemmas suppose we have a
finite sequence of numbers meeting certain constraints, and
provide the number of cycle shifts that contain
all-positive partial sums [@raney].

These notes expand on the ideas behind these lemmas.
The final section of these notes discusses cyclic shifts for
finite sequences of independent, uniformly random
values; as far as I know, the work in that section is new.

I personally learned of these lemmas in chapter 7 of
the book *Concrete Mathematics* [@concrete],
which explores their applications to generating functions.
The presentation of the lemmas here is based on the
presentation in *Concrete Mathematics* rather than on
Raney's original paper.

# Exact values for finite integer sequences

**Lemma 1**
*Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$, where all $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$.
Extend the sequence by letting $x_{n+p}=x_p$ for $1\le p\le n$.
Then there is a unique $j$, $1 \le j \le n$, such that*

$$\sum_{i=j}^{j+k-1} x_i > 0; \quad 1 \le k \le n.$$

Intuitively, we can think of such an index $j$ as a cyclic shift
of the sequence that has partial sums that are all positive.

For example, the finite sequence
$\langle x_1, \ldots, x_5\rangle = \langle 3, -2, 4, -1, 1 \rangle$
offers $j=5$ as the unique shift providing
$\langle x_5, x_6=x_1, \ldots, x_9=x_4\rangle = \langle 1, 3, -2, 4, -5\rangle$
with partial sums
$\langle 1, 4, 2, 6, 1\rangle$ that are all positive.

Given a sequence $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n\rangle$, it's useful to say that
an index $i \in \{1,\ldots, n\}$ is a *positive-sum shift* if and only if
the partial sums of $\langle x_i, \ldots, x_n, x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}\rangle$
are all positive. Since these notes focus on finite sequences, we'll also
implicitly use arbitrary indexes $x_j, j\in\mathbb{Z}$, to refer to
$x_k$ with $k\in \{1, \ldots, n\}, k\equiv j \pmod n$.

Raney also proved the related result:

**Lemma 2**
*Suppose $\sum_{i=1}^nx_i=\ell$, where $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and
$x_i \le 1$ for all $i$.
Then exactly $\ell$ indexes in $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ are
positive-sum shifts.*

---

For example, let $\langle x_1, \ldots, x_8\rangle =
\langle -2, 1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 1\rangle$. Then
$\sum x_i = 2$, and $x_2, x_6$ are the only
positive-sum shifts:

 shift | partial sums
-------|----------------
$\langle x_2, \ldots\rangle = \langle 1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 1, -2\rangle\quad$ | $\langle 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2\rangle$
$\langle x_6, \ldots\rangle = \langle 1, 1, 1, -2, 1, 1, 0, -1\rangle\quad$ | $\langle 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2\rangle$
